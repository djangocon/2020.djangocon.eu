DESCRIPTION:"This site uses cookies"... no kidding! Every site uses cookies
 ! Cookies are a much maligned\, but essential part of the web experience. 
 But what actually *are* cookies? Why are they needed? How do they work? Ho
 w are they used? How are they misused? And how have they changed as the mo
 dern web as evolved? \n\nIn this talk\, you'll get a complete history of b
 rowser cookies\, and a deep dive into the cookie specification. You'll lea
 rn the various ways your Django site uses cookies\, and how others can use
  use cookies on your site. And you'll get a preview of some changes that m
 ay be coming to the way the web uses cookies.

 ‚Äúreal‚Äù\, and what is a ‚Äújob‚Äù. \n\nAs a person who allegedly does n
 ot have a real job\, and who comes from a country (Belgium) whose reality 
 some people also doubt\, I am ideally placed to make these discoveries. I 
 will enlist the assistance of some famous Belgians\, including the famous 
 philosopher-actor Jean-Claude Van Damme (not a real actor\, according to s
 ome\; not a real philosopher\, according to others) and the artist Ren√© M
 agritte. \n\nI plan to show that being a web developer is not really a job

DESCRIPTION:GraphQL is a more flexible alternative to REST for building web
  APIs\, and thus is becoming a strong foundation for any modern web stack.
  This is especially true where static HTML templates are not cutting it or
  a sophisticated single-page interface is needed\, which is often the case
  on the web nowadays. Even though Django was designed as a model-view-temp
 late framework\, it can work perfectly well as a GraphQL server to power J
 avaScript apps. This talk will elaborate on the anatomy of a GraphQL-first
  Django application\, in which GraphQL queries and mutations are the prima
 ry interfaces exposed by the backend\, while the frontend remains fully dy
 namic.

DESCRIPTION:I like websites with search bars. If the search function works 
 well\, I can enter a few words and get a list of results\, with the things
  that interest me at the top. Whether you use it as a help system or for p
 roduct information\, search functionality can add a lot of value to a Djan
 go application. But implementing proper search functionality is not easy. 
 Django offers multiple ways to implement search functionality\, each with 
 its advantages and disadvantages.\n This talk will give you an overview of
  the different ways in which you can implement search functionality in Dja
 ngo. We will look at the full-text search options that come with databases
  and the use of a dedicated search engine like Elastic Search or Postgres.
  Along the way\, you will learn about the different ways in which you can 
 index your data to learn how to evaluate your search results.
