DESCRIPTION:GraphQL is a more flexible alternative to REST for building web
  APIs\, and thus is becoming a strong foundation for any modern web stack.
  This is especially true where static HTML templates are not cutting it or
  a sophisticated single-page interface is needed\, which is often the case
  on the web nowadays. Even though Django was designed as a model-view-temp
 late framework\, it can work perfectly well as a GraphQL server to power J
 avaScript apps. This talk will elaborate on the anatomy of a GraphQL-first
  Django application\, in which GraphQL queries and mutations are the prima
 ry interfaces exposed by the backend\, while the frontend remains fully dy
 namic.
