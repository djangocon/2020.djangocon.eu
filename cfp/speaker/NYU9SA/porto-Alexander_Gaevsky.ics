DESCRIPTION:The Google Maps SDK: well-known\, powerful\, and extremely popu
 lar - and after July 2018\, suddenly unaffordable. We needed to find an al
 ternative for Django geospatial projects. This is the story of our search 
 and what we found\, and the lessons that we’d like to share from the exp
 erience. The good news is: we returned with new knowledge from our wanderi
 ngs\, and were able to migrate our existing projects successfully.
