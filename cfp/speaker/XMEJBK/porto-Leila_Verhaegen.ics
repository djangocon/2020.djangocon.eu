DESCRIPTION:More than once I have had the pleasure of being informed that m
 y job (which by the way\, is also the job of quite a few members of the Dj
 angoCon audience) is not a “real” job.\n\nIn this talk I will try to d
 iscover what a “real job” is. I will also find out more about what is 
 “real”\, and what is a “job”. \n\nAs a person who allegedly does n
 ot have a real job\, and who comes from a country (Belgium) whose reality 
 some people also doubt\, I am ideally placed to make these discoveries. I 
 will enlist the assistance of some famous Belgians\, including the famous 
 philosopher-actor Jean-Claude Van Damme (not a real actor\, according to s
 ome\; not a real philosopher\, according to others) and the artist René M
 agritte. \n\nI plan to show that being a web developer is not really a job
  - it’s much more important than that.
