DESCRIPTION:Why did Facebook have a public Django-based site that got hacke
 d? What was the flaw discovered in GitHub's password reset mechanism that 
 was also found to affect Django auth? Are *your* projects vulnerable?\n\nI
 'll walk you through some stories of common web vulnerabilities\, and what
  they mean for Django. I've had the pleasure of working on over 50 Django 
 projects so far\, so I've seen some patterns emerge.
