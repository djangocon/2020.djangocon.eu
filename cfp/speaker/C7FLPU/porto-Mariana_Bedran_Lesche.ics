DESCRIPTION:In the software industry\, developers\, designers and stakehold
 ers should be working together to achieve the same goals and deliver high 
 quality products to the final users. To be actually able to work together 
 in an efficient and harmonic way\, though\, is a whole other thing. In a t
 eam composed by developers and designers\, we were able to mitigate the im
 pact of communication flaws and concepts divergences in a continuous effor
 t to cover  the blank spots we found on every iteration we went through. I
 n this talk I’m going to share some lessons learned about how to integra
 te both teams’ work with a solid management process.
