DESCRIPTION:I like websites with search bars. If the search function works 
 well\, I can enter a few words and get a list of results\, with the things
  that interest me at the top. Whether you use it as a help system or for p
 roduct information\, search functionality can add a lot of value to a Djan
 go application. But implementing proper search functionality is not easy. 
 Django offers multiple ways to implement search functionality\, each with 
 its advantages and disadvantages.\n This talk will give you an overview of
  the different ways in which you can implement search functionality in Dja
 ngo. We will look at the full-text search options that come with databases
  and the use of a dedicated search engine like Elastic Search or Postgres.
  Along the way\, you will learn about the different ways in which you can 
 index your data to learn how to evaluate your search results.
