    <meta name="description" content="Whether you like it or not - if you&#39;re using the web, you use cookies. HTTP is a stateless protocol; without a mechanism to preserve a user&#39;s state between requests, many of the web interactions we take for granted would be much more difficult. For most websites, cookies are that mechanism.

This talk will provide a deep dive into the history and use of cookies. You&#39;ll get a walk through of the what and how of everything that can be done with cookies, and you&#39;ll see how to control those properties in your Django site. You&#39;ll also get a brief overview of the the ways cookies can be abused, and how governments are intervening on behalf of users. Lastly, you&#39;ll learn about some proposals that are working their way through standards organizations that could radically change how sites use cookies.

And, if you&#39;re really, really good and stay all the way to the end, I&#39;ll share my secret family choc-chip cookie recipe.

Why are they needed? How do they work? How are they used? How are they misused? And how have they changed as the modern web as evolved? </p>
<p>In this talk, you'll get a complete history of browser cookies, and a deep dive into the cookie specification. You'll learn the various ways your Django site uses cookies, and how others can use use cookies on your site. And you'll get a preview of some changes that may be coming to the way the web uses cookies.</p>
