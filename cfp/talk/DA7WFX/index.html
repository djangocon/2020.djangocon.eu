    <meta name="title" content="A Pentester&#39;s Thoughts on Django Security  - DjangoCon Europe 2020 pretalx">
    <meta name="description" content="**Motivation**

By day, I work as a penetration tester trying to find security vulnerabilities in other people&#39;s web applications. By night, I develop my own Django-based web application and try not to make the same mistakes I see in my customer&#39;s applications. Within the last two years of working with Django, I could not stop being amazed by the security focus of the Django team.

**Praise and History**

In a short history lesson, I want to point out a few design choices and decisions the Django team has made over the years which make me very comfortable with using Django as a web framework because they are proof that the Django team takes security very seriously.

**Django Security Features and their limitations**

While it is amazing what Django does for security already out of the box, it does not replace developer awareness. I would like to give an overview of Django&#39;s security features and point out their (already known and documented) limitations especially in cases where developer&#39;s might have a false sense of &quot;security is already taken care off&quot;.

**Best Practices**

Finally, I will share some security best practices which will help avoiding unnecessary pentest findings and support you with keeping your applications secure.
