    <title>Developing a Security Mindset: Practical Lessons for Pythonistas ::  DjangoCon Europe 2020 :: pretalx</title>
    <meta name="title" content="Developing a Security Mindset: Practical Lessons for Pythonistas  - DjangoCon Europe 2020 pretalx">
    <meta name="description" content="As more of the world is run by software, software security becomes increasingly important. As developers, we have a lot on our plate already and developing your security mindset may seem intimidating. It might seem that security should just altogether be someone else’s job.

This talk will discuss why developers should grow their security mindset and will give them practical advice for how to do so—even in a workplace where many issues compete for their attention.

If you are new to security, this is the talk for you. If you know a bit and want to help your team strengthen their security posture, this talk is for you. If you want to take the next step in your security journey, this talk will point the way.
