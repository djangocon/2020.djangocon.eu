DESCRIPTION:Ever had a ModelForm\, a DRF Serializer\, a FilterSet grind to 
 a halt rendering a choice field? Of course you have. Ever given up on it a
 nd resorted to raw ids? -- No don't answer that.\n\nWe're going to look at
  how you can get a grip on ModelChoiceField when you're dealing with lots 
 of related objects\, and when you need to offer that choice again and agai
 n and again\, without needing to put the kettle on.
