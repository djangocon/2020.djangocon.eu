DESCRIPTION:"This site uses cookies"... no kidding! Every site uses cookies
 ! Cookies are a much maligned\, but essential part of the web experience. 
 But what actually *are* cookies? Why are they needed? How do they work? Ho
 w are they used? How are they misused? And how have they changed as the mo
 dern web as evolved? \n\nIn this talk\, you'll get a complete history of b
 rowser cookies\, and a deep dive into the cookie specification. You'll lea
 rn the various ways your Django site uses cookies\, and how others can use
  use cookies on your site. And you'll get a preview of some changes that m
 ay be coming to the way the web uses cookies.
