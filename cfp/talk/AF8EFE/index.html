    <meta name="description" content="Speaking at a programming conference may seem like an impossible goal for many people, for a number of reasons: fear of public speaking, the feeling that you don&#39;t know enough to give a talk, you don&#39;t think you have any good ideas for a talk, or maybe the idea that public speaking is very difficult. I&#39;m going to persuade you that you _should_ get up on stage and give a talk to your peers. Once I&#39;ve persuaded you that you should give a talk, then I&#39;m going to show you _how_.

## Coming up with an idea

Coming up with an idea can sometimes be the hardest part! I&#39;ll cover how to get (and keep) ideas by looking at what you do every day, what you know most about, and keeping a notebook of ideas so that when the time comes to submit a proposal, you&#39;ll have plenty of choice.

## Submitting a proposal

Submitting a proposal to a CFP can seem quite daunting. Even if it doesn&#39;t seem daunting, there are a bunch of things you can get wrong that make it less likely for your talk to be accepted. I&#39;ll give you several tips for increasing your chances of being selected. I&#39;ll also talk about _rejection_ and why you shouldn&#39;t feel dejected about being rejected. (It happens to everyone!)

## Writing a talk

I&#39;ll describe some processes for writing a talk and building a slide deck to match (if you want to!) I&#39;ll cover some different styles of public speaking, including how to find your own style, and I&#39;ll talk about live coding. (With a strong recommendation that you shouldn&#39;t do it - at least until you&#39;ve got more experience.)

## Preparation

**Practice, practice, practice!** Many inexperienced speakers underestimate how much rehearsal is required to give a great talk; I&#39;m going to correct this misunderstanding! I&#39;ll cover some different approaches to ensuring that you&#39;re less nervous when it&#39;s time to step on to the stage, and you&#39;ve maximised your chances of your talk going smoothly.

## Giving your talk

After you&#39;ve had an idea, had your proposal accepted, written your talk, designed your slides, and practiced (and practiced and practiced) it&#39;ll be time to step behind the lectern and give your talk! I&#39;ll give you tried and tested advice from experienced speakers to help your talk go smoothly.

And you know what? Even if some things go wrong you&#39;ll still be applauded enthusiastically by an audience of your peers!
