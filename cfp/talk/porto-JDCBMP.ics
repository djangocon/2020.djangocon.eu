DESCRIPTION:Curious how to put your code into a deadlock? Want infinite loo
 ps\, but in parallel? Or just want a new\, exciting kind of data corruptio
 n? We'll look at these and other ways that asynchronous code can make you 
 write some spectacularly nasty code\, as well as the ways Django tries to 
 save you from these terrible fates.
