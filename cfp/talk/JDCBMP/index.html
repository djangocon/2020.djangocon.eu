    <meta name="description" content="Django has a reputation for being safe and reliable, but what happens when you take that reputation and push it up against Python&#39;s hot new frontier that is asynchronous support?

Asynchronous code has many pitfalls that you won&#39;t be used to from traditional, synchronous programming - we&#39;ll take a look at them, and how they crop up in Django&#39;s request cycle. Some of them you can wander into via an easy mistake; some of them are caused by Django contributors getting things subtly wrong in the core code; and some of them are just plain fun to try.

We&#39;ll also talk about Django&#39;s culture of safety, how to protect against these issues both automatically and with manual review, and what asynchronous programming means for safety in programming at large.
