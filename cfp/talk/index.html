            <p>
                <p>When writing multi-tenant applications, a very typical and dangerous bug is to forget about a WHERE statement and show data to the wrong users. This often goes unnoticed, since most people are only testing with one user account. This talk discusses strategies to prevent this class of error entirely.</p>

                <p>Django ships with a built-in migration framework since version 1.7 in 2014. While migrations are widely used by almost every Django project ever since, there is little known about the internals of the migration framework. This talk will look into its components and how they are tied together.</p>
