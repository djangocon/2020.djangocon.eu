First off, a warning: all of the following numbers are approximate and may change – we don't know the future, and we may have to adjust to changed circumstances in a number of ways.

DjangoCon Europe has three conference days reserved for talks (followed by two days of sprints with tutorials on the side). Past experience shows that more than 10 talks per day (plus room for lightning talks) is a bit much, so we're looking at about 30 talk slots we can distribute among submissions. Of these 30:

* 3 will go to **keynote** speakers selected by us. We're very much open to suggestions, so contact us if there is anybody you'd like to see or hear as a keynote speaker!

* 6 **community talks**. These are meant to show the struggles we face as a community, and as individuals. They can include talks on personal growth, or demonstrate problems that are still waiting to be resolved.

* 4 **project presentations**. These talks show ways and areas in which Django may be used.

* 15 talks about **Django and working with Django**:

  * 6 talks **accessible to beginners**, focussing on concepts, introductions, guides, and other material most useful to those new to Django, having used Django for about a year or less. Includes common workflows (like debugging and testing) and introductions to tools integrated with Django.

  * 6 more **advanced talks**, explaining concepts or implementation details in depth, for people who have used Django for more than a year. Includes uncommon workflows, and improvements on testing and debugging workflows.

  * 3 talks at a **very advanced level** on implementation details and planned features. We also hope to offer a bit of the Django Under The Hood spirit here.

* 2 talks focusing on languages or frameworks that are **not Django**.

If your talk idea does not match any of these categories, or matches more than one – don't worry! This is not a strict list that every submission needs to fit in, it is just meant as a guide for attendees, submitters, and reviewers alike.
