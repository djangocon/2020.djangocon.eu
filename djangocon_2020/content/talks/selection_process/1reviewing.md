<!-- TODO: complete review team -->
<!-- Our review team is made up of 6 people from the organiser team and 1 from outside. We are a mix of organisers, some core developers and DSF (Django Software Foundation) members, and some Django Girls members/organisers. -->

Reviewers will be asked to look at a set of submissions and submit a review (both a few words and a rough rating). After the review period is over, we will go through the talks by category and select the talks based on accumulated reviews. If we can't make the decision among two or three talks, we'll check back with the reviewers and ask them for their opinion.

We'll of course notify you regardless of the review outcome with the result. We'll probably send out some of the acceptance mails before the rejection mails, to give accepted speakers a chance to step back, in case they cannot attend after all. Regardless of our decision, feel free to ping us for feedback and we'll give you an overview over reviewer opinions!

We value your feedback. If you have any questions, concerns or wish to volunteer for the review team, please get in touch with [content@djangocon.eu](mailto:content@djangocon.eu).
