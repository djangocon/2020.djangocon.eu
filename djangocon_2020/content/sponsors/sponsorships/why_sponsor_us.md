Why should you sponsor?

**Marketing** Do you have a product, service or brand that is loved by or will be loved by the Django/Python developers and forward thinking entrepreneurs in Europe and the Nordics? Here you can expose your self digitally, on printed material and if you wish meet everyone by having a booth.

**Recruitment** Let's admit, software developers are hard to get and they are not actively looking for a job themselves. Therefore, to meet and be present for the world's best Django developers at this event is both lucrative and unique.

**Giving Back** Be a community leader and give back to the open-source community Django _is_. As a part of the conference individuals from all countries can apply for grants to make it possible to attend this, for some, life-changing event. The conference must be affordable because many contributors to Django, attendees and speakers would not otherwise be able to attend without sponsorships from the community. Please consider supporting with **any** amount to give everyone involved an opportunity to attend.

**Diversity** Everyone is welcome at DjangoCon Europe, should be able to attend this conference and be in their comfort zone while doing so. The Django community puts pride and effort into diversity, respecting each other and *being excellent* to one another. Diversity encapsulates much and we with this conference are proud to embrace it! [Diversity](https://www.djangoproject.com/diversity/) is a part of the Django Project's DNA and always will be.

**Networking** If you want to stand out from the crowd with your company, network and seek new potential collaborations and partners, DjangoCon Europe is the place to be. Also, with most sponsor packages are tickets included and your employees will, therefore, attend a conference with valuable education from talks and workshops.

We would love to hear your needs and are open for customising the packages to fit your business, brand and organisation.
