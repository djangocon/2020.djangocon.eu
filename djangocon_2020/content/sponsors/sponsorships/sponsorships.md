This 12th edition of DjangoCon Europe and it is the westernmost edition taking place in the beatiful city of Porto, in the north of Portugal 🇵🇹.

DjangoCon Europe is a conference run **by** the Django community **for** the Django community and we believe this is the best conference for partners and sponsors to connect **with** the Django community and to be part of it.

DjangoCon Europe has existed for more than a decade and is therefore very professionally run, 100% by passionate volunteers and on a not-for-profit basis.
