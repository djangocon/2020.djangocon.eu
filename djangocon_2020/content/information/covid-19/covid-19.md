Current Covid-19 peak estimates are too close to the original dates (May 27-31), we can not delay making a decision anymore. Some conferences are postponing, others canceling altogether.

So, before considering canceling DjangoCon Europe 2020, optimistically we will first try to postpone it.

**We are postponing DjangoCon Europe 2020 to September 16-20.**

We are aware that many things can change meanwhile, and that in the end we might be forced to cancel the conference, but for now, we urge you to believe with us.

Many of you have already bought tickets, and to those, we kindly ask to hope with us.

Ticket refunds will happen in any of the following scenarios:
- Participant's inability to participate, due to restrictions in place at the time or unavailability on the new dates.
- Conference Cancellation

Please do no rush requesting ticket refunds, we will process them as we can. Please note that a ticket refunded and latter on bought again has double the fees for us. So delay your decision for as long as you can.
  
If everything goes well we will have a conference and we count on you to be there. 

For those of you who are planning or have already booked your flights with TAP, our official carrier, [here](https://www.flytap.com/en-pt/book-with-confidence) is some important information. In short, they have plans for flight reschedule free of charge.
