DjangoCon Europe 2020 organizers are keeping close attention to the Covid-19 outbreak.

At this time we do not have any plans to postpone or cancel the conference. If the time comes to change this decision we will act accordingly, including ticket refunds.

For those of you who are planning or have already booked your flights with TAP, our official carrier, [here](https://www.flytap.com/en-pt/book-with-confidence) is some important information. In short, they have plans for flight reschedule free of charge.

We are following the World Health Organization (WHO) [guidelines](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/key-planning-recommendations-for-mass-gatherings-in-the-context-of-the-current-covid-19-outbreak), as well as the Portuguese Direcção Geral da Saude (DGS) [guidelines](https://www.dgs.pt/normas-orientacoes-e-informacoes/informacoes/informacao-n-0062020-de-280220201.aspx) in Portuguese.

The general guidelines include, but are not limited to:

- We ask all participants who have been in critical disease zones, at the time of the event, to communicate with the organization. Together we will evaluate the actual presence and refund when applicable.

- at the reception, the organization will have hand sanitizers, infrared thermometers, masks (exclusive for hazardous situations) and a garbage bin of sanitary waste. A DGS approved poster will be displayed with the instructions for basic procedures.

- those who request or appear symptomatic, we will have a thermometer for fever screening and we will provide together with local authorities an isolation room for people with symptoms to be able to wait for the presence of health authorities.
 
- all recommendations regarding staff will be followed according to instructions given by DGS.
