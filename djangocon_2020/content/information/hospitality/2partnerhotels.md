The fee is 2 € per person / night in all tourist resorts and local accommodation, up to a maximum of 7 consecutive nights per person / stay, regardless of the type of booking (face-to-face, analog or digital). It is not subject to VAT according to  article nº2 section 2 of the Value Added Tax Code (that  tax is no longer payable from the 7th night).
