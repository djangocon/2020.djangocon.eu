If your country is not part of the [Schengen Agreement](https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/who-needs-schengen-visa/), you will need to request a tourist Visa in the Portuguese Embassy. Please refer to your local embassy for information on processing time. According to the information provided by the Portuguese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we have compiled this list with the necessary documents to obtain a [Short Stay Visa](https://www.vistos.mne.pt/en/short-stay-visas-schengen/required-documentation/short-stay-visa#refer-to-the-harmonized-documents-table-concerning-required-documents-for-visa-application-lodging-in-specific-countries).

* An invitation letter from the DjangoCon organisation team

After you have purchased your DjangoCon ticket, send an e-mail to [hospitality@djangocon.eu](mailto:hospitality@djangocon.eu) with: the purchased ticket, your full name, your address, a copy of your passport, your company and/or university name and address.

* Travel Insurance 

This insurance should cover the entire Schengen Area and be valid for the expected duration of you stay. The minimum coverage must be 30,000 EUR.

* A passport or other valid travel document

Your passport/travel document must be valid for at least three months after your planned departure date. Moreover, your passport/travel document must have been issued within the past ten years and must have at least two blank pages.
