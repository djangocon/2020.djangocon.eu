Besides Sprints we will also have workshops on various topics. These will be announced in the schedule.

The Sprints are free for all conference participants. However, as the Sprints venue does not have unlimited capacity, and we would like to prepare a precise amount of food and drinks, please keep your participation status updated on the pretix website (after buying your ticket).
