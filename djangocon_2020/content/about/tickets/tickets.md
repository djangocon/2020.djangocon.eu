The **early bird ticket sales** <u>ends February 29</u>. DjangoCon Europe always sells out, and we have a limited number of tickets for sale. Therefore, we strongly encourage you to buy your ticket before they sell out, which in addition gives you more time to plan your trip and can save money on accommodation and transport.

All tickets include access to all 3 conference days (May 27 - 29) and the 2 [sprints](#) days (May 30 - 31). 

If you wish to change from Individual to Business or any other way amend the order please contact [2020@djangocon.eu](mailto:2020@djangocon.eu).

These are the ticket types that are on sale (VAT included):

* <strong>Student/Concession Ticket (€190)</strong>
If you are currently enrolled as a full-time student or if you are currently without regular income. This ticket does not cover our costs for the conference, but we'll be able to provide it to you thanks to other people paying more for their ticket than the minimal price. Please note that there is a limited number of student/concession tickets.
* <strong>Individual Ticket (<del>€295</del> €265)</strong>
If you are paying your ticket from your personal money and are not being reimbursed by your employer.
* <strong>Individual Supporter Ticket (<del>€345</del> €315)</strong>
If you are paying your ticket from your personal money and are not being reimbursed by your employer. The additional money from this ticket type ensure we can afford offering cheaper tickets to students and other people who could not afford to join otherwise. Thank you for doing so!
* <strong>Business Ticket (<del>€395</del> €365)</strong>
If your employer is paying for the ticket or reimbursing you for your conference expenses.
* <strong>Business Supporter Ticket (<del>€495</del> €465)</strong>
Choose this ticket type if you or your employer want to especially support us doing this conference.
