In order to make it accessible for everyone without any kind of barrier we have decided to offer this conference **free** of charge to the community. However, there was a lot of work and expenses involved in making it come to life - as such, **your support is indispensable**. All funds will be used to support outreach and diversity, covering both this year's expenses and granting affordable access for students and financial aid in the next year.

**If you are in a financial situation that does not allow you to support the event, do not feel pressured to contribute and get a free ticket!**
